After installing Raspbian Wheezy and booting for the first time, do the following.

Make the following changes in raspi-config
- Expand filesystem
- Set correct timezone (Internationalisation Options)
- Change keyboard layout (Internationalisation Options)
- decrease amount of memory for the GPU to 16M (Advanced Options)
- enabled SSH (Advanced Options)

Download and run the install script via the command line
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codenozzle/java-pi/master/install.sh
sudo chmod 755 install.sh
./install.sh

Follow the onscreen prompts and answer Yes to all. You will be asked to pick a default Java version. I suggest the Java 8 ARM version. It should be #2.

Lastly, run the configure script
./configure.sh
